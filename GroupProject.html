#   Conclusion

- Summary
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- Pairwise to regrouping the variables, regression models, final model, odds ratio,           --&gt;
- Real-World Applicability 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- This is useful in understanding which variables might impact your chances of succeeding in this case for credit card approval. It also lets you know what you might have to improve on, like reducing your debt or getting a job, making your chances of being approved higher.           --&gt;
- Why a Regression Model?
&lt;br&gt;
